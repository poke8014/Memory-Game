## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [X] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [X] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

A challenge that I encountered while creating this submission was working and learning multiple languages at the same time. I was 
reminded of how difficult it is to get help by reading other people's code especially when the language is still unfamiliar and 
fundamental concepts are weak. Although the tutorial provided enough information in the drop down tabs for me to understand the 
bare minimum of what the app had to do in order to function, I found it incredibly frustrating trying to search for questions 
similar to mine on stack overflow. With almost everything you could possibly want to learn on the internet, it comes down to 
how well you can express what you're looking for.

Though I was able to find information on how to print a variable in javasript onto html, I had a hard time understanding how exactly 
to implement it into my own code. That's where I think more structured courses and tutorials come into play to help provide beginners 
with all the relevant information they need to succeed. I really took the time to read through every last bit in the dropdown tabs to 
make sure I understood the code that the tutorial provided before I moved onto the next chunk of code. For that reason, some parts took 
a bit longer to get through as I had to sit and digest what I was reading. By the time I had finished, it felt natural that the three 
languages I had just worked with were paired with each other. As I worked with the languages more, I was able to understand what people 
were talking about on stack overflow, but it was still hard implement on my own. I would usually approach a professor or friend in order 
to help clarify topics that confuse me. However, I was not able to do so this time around, and so the additional features that I tried 
to implement have been dropped for now.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Some questions I have about web development include:
How many people work on a single webpage and how do they divide up the work?
Does everyone work on a single component on the page or do they work in a single language?
It would make sense if everyone knew how to program in all required languages and then completed individual
parts to be able to identify their own bugs and be held accountable for it.

Once a website/webapp is finished, how do developers figure out what updates they want to push?
How do they identify parts that need to be fixed and how do they know when they should go back to maintain
their code? What are the key differences between people that know how to develop full-stack as opposed to 
those that focus on just front or back-end development?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would like to learn how to play chords when the buttons are pressed. I have 
always been interested in music, so I tried implementing playing multiple tones at once for 30 minutes before I moved on to trying 
to implement a different feature. I thought that playing different sound effects might have been easier as you just had to import 
a sound file and play that, but I haven't actually tried my hand at it. There was also the fact that the prework had a link to a tutorial
on how to implement this. The other feature that I thought would have been really useful while playing the game was giving players multiple 
chances, so I was trying to display that number, but I had trouble figuring out how to display variables used in javascript onto html. 
I also tried this for 30 minutes before having to move on due to time constraints. I would really like to learn how to implement these 
two features if I had more time to work on this project.
